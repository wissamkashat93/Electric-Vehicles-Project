# Electric Vehicles Project

This project aims to analyze and provide insights into electric vehicles (EVs). The objective is to understand trends and patterns in electric vehicle data through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of various machine learning models.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to analyze electric vehicle data to uncover significant trends and patterns. This involves cleaning the data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applying machine learning models to gain insights into the electric vehicle market.

## Data Cleaning

The data cleaning process involved several steps to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Identified and dealt with missing values in the dataset.
2. **Data Type Conversion**: Converted data types to appropriate formats for analysis.
3. **Removing Duplicates**: Checked for and removed duplicate records.
4. **Filtering Data**: Applied filters to remove any irrelevant or extreme values.
5. **Feature Engineering**: Created new features to enhance the analysis and model performance.

## Usage

### Running the Jupyter Notebook

The main analysis and results are contained in the Jupyter Notebook `NewElectricVehiclesProjectFinal.ipynb`. To run the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook NewElectricVehiclesProjectFinal.ipynb
```
